The premmise of the game is simple

1) Load a bullet into a single chamber.
2) Spin the chambers around.
3) Close the chamber and place your bets on who dies first.
4) Put gun to head, pull trigger.
5) Repeat step four until one of the players die from a horrifying gunshot wound to the head.
6) Go to step 1.

This isn't as gruesome as the real thing, but does have the potential to fuck up your day.

DO NOT RUN IT IF YOU CANNOT TAKE A JOKE.
DO NOT RUN BEFORE SAVING YOUR WORK.

I take no responsibility at all for any and all damages caused by your stupidity.

It has been tested in Windows 95, 98, XP, and 7. It should run on any version of Windows from 95 to 8 including the server varients.

Wondering why I coded such a thing? Well I was bored, and intrigued by the increasing popularity of games that have consequences if you loose.
This just takes it to the extreme. Just like if you were to play with a real gun but with no blood or cops to deal with.
